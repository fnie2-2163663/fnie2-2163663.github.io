<div class="articles">
    Bilibili (stylized bilibili, simplified Chinese: 哔哩哔哩; traditional Chinese: 嗶哩嗶哩; pinyin: bīlībīlī), also nicknamed B Site (B站) in China, is a Chinese video sharing website based in Shanghai, themed around animation, comics, and games (ACG), where users can submit, view and add overlaid commentary on videos. Bilibili uses Adobe Flash or HTML5 player, to play user submitted videos hosted by either itself or third-party sources, featuring a scrolling danmu ("bullet curtain" : 弹幕 Chinese: danmu; Japanese: danmaku) commenting system. Since the mid-2010s, Bilibili began to expand to a broader audience from its original niche market that focused on animation and games, and it has become one of the major Chinese video on demand over-the-top streaming platforms that programs critically acclaimed and popular documentaries, variety shows, and other original programming.

Bilibili provides a live streaming service where the audience can interact with streamers. Other than videos, Bilibili also offers games, mostly ACG-themed mobile games, such as the Chinese version of Fate/Grand Order.
